# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** Sprint 2

**Scrum Master**: Justin Oliver

**Git Master**: Stephen Wilson

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Creating core data structures and the foundational functionality of the program. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 16

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 9

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We first walked through the user stories in the product backlog and tried to realign first based on priority. We placed the higher priority items near the top and lower towards the bottom. 
Then we talked through about what our goal is this sprint (functionality and data structures) and realigned the items on the top of the list. We then took at the velocity forecasting to determine how much we can take on, and picked from the top of the list the user stories we decided as a group would be the most benficial to accomplish this sprint. 

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We all are aligned on the high level functionality of what we are trying to accomplish. We all seem motivated to want to achieve a good working product, and we
are all aligned that in order to accomplish that we need to get the current user stories in the sprint completed. We had a discussion about how much we think we can reasonably accomplished,
and that is what is pulled into the current sprint. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, each member of the team has reviewed the project requirements in detail, we discussed the requirements again in the sprint planning session, and we understand what is expected of us.

 

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)
