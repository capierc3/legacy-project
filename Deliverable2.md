# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** Sprint 2

**Scrum Master**: Justin Oliver

**Git Master**: Stephen Wilson

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Creating core data structures and the foundational functionality of the program. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 16

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 9

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We first walked through the user stories in the product backlog and tried to realign first based on priority. We placed the higher priority items near the top and lower towards the bottom. 
Then we talked through about what our goal is this sprint (functionality and data structures) and realigned the items on the top of the list. We then took at the velocity forecasting to determine how much we can take on, and picked from the top of the list the user stories we decided as a group would be the most beneficial to accomplish this sprint. 

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We all are aligned on the high level functionality of what we are trying to accomplish. We all seem motivated to want to achieve a good working product, and we
are all aligned that in order to accomplish that we need to get the current user stories in the sprint completed. We had a discussion about how much we think we can reasonably accomplished,
and that is what is pulled into the current sprint. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, each member of the team has reviewed the project requirements in detail, we discussed the requirements again in the sprint planning session, and we understand what is expected of us.

 

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: 

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The main value we believe we created are the backbones and the framework for a functioning gym scheduling system. We also changed the overall feel of the site so it looks more like a gym scheduling system and less like a generic program. Some of the functionality includes:

- A user login screen
- Trainer profiles page with trainer profiles and the ability to add and edit the profiles
- A calendar planning tool with the ability to schedule upcoming classes
- Java classes that implement the basic functionality required in a gym scheduling program
- A test package for Junit and code coverage tests
- The ability to run Spotbugs and Checkstyle to help with static analysis

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> As a team, I think we worked beyond what was expected. We lost a team member early on this sprint, and we all tried to pick up the pieces and keep our team moving forward. There was also a lot of additional work that went into play this sprint compared to what was planned for, because we did not take into account how difficult the Memoranda code base would be to work with. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Unfortunately, we did not quite meet the customers' expectations this sprint. The main reason being we set out at the beginning of this sprint to accomplish 9 user stories. However, due to losing a team member earlier in the sprint, we weren't able to accomplish 2 of those user stories. This made us fall a little short of what the customer expectations should have been at the end of this sprint. 

### Sprint Retrospective

> 

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we believe the sprint goal of "Creating core data structures and the foundational functionality of the program" was met. The core data structures that are needed as the backbone of the system now exist as does some basic functionality that can be built upon. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> No, we did not complete all the stories in the backlog. Due to losing a team member early in the sprint, we had two user stories that we were not able to complete. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We lost a team member early on in this sprint. During the sprint planning, we looked at the velocity forecast based on points assigned to User Stories, and laid out a plan that would be pushing it a little, but should have been feasible with 5 members. Once we lost that 5th member, that goal wasn't realistically attainable. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> We started off the sprint right along the lines of what would be expected according to the burndown chart. But a few days in, as the bigger User Stories' tasks started to come into play, we hit a little bit of a flat spot on our burndown chart. The main reasoning for this is that some of the tasks that we were attempting turned out to be a little tougher than we anticipated, and so they spent more time in the "in process" spots than we anticipated. Work was still being done on the user stories and this can be seen by the commit history in Github. Once we got over that slight hurdle, we got back on track and finished out the last couple days at about the anticipated pace.  

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We definitely delivered business value in this sprint. The program went from just being a program that would open and close, to something that looks like a gym scheduling system. There is also a lot of the framework and functionality built into the back end that will really help with the future development of the program.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> I don't think we anticipated how difficult some of the tasks could be. Before last sprint we had a meeting where we talked both high level and low level functionality, and how we thought stuff should go together. Once we started diving into what we discussed, you could say things were easier said then done. We think now that we have a better understanding of the system and code we were given, it should allow us to make better plans and decisions about what we should realistically be able to accomplish this next sprint. 

> We had a few user stories that were dependent on other stories being completed. We didn't really do a great job of listing out what was dependent on others, and this created some blockage as tasks were trying to be accomplished. We will take this lesson learned and apply it to the next sprint planning session.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

>  Overall we are pretty optimistic that we will be able to accomplish the goal of this project. We are all feeling more and more comfortable working together as a team and understanding each others strengths and weaknesses. The flow of the teamwork right now seems pretty solid, and other than the time constraint there aren't really a lot of hurdles.

   **How did you contribute to Static Analysis:
 
     - Added junit and jacoco to the gradle build.  
     - Made some minor changes to the Checkstyle xml file based on team discussion. 
     - Added some code to the gradle build file that would allow the project to build 
     - while ignoring some spotbugs errors, as it didn't make sense to fix the massive amounts during the sprint.
     - We didn't want to total remove spotbugs as it was a useful tool, but we also didn't want it to limit
     - our production. 
  
  **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:
 
     - Created the task in Taiga to have the quality policy updated as per the project requirements, focusing on SA. Facilitated a discussion with the team
     surrounding SA and any other updates, and after conversation with the team went ahead and updated the policy according to our standards laid out in the discussions.
