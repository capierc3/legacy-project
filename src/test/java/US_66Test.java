/* 
 * @author Justin
 * This is a class to test User Story 66
 * The purpose of this user story was to create the appropriate panels to help with further development
 * and to allow the buttons on the left nav to point to the appropriate places
 * The purpose was not to achieve ultimate functionality, that will be worked on later on in a later user story
 */

/**
 * White box testing was done by Justin. This was done via code review and by checking the functionality within the program itself
 * and insuring the pages are rendering the correct panels. I also checked to 
 * ensure that the buttons were linking to the correct panels. For this use case, I'm not quite sure if 
 * white box testing with assert messages is possible. 
 * Code coverage is not applicable in this US because the goal was to just create the templates so they are workable
 * The functionality of them (other than pointing and rendering), including removing old code
 * will be completed in a different user story.
