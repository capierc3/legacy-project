 * This is a class to help with testing
 * It is designed to be used as a template for either whitebox or blackbox testing
 * To use, create a copy of this file and name accordingly.
 * Modify/add any tests you need
 * Please do not modify this sample test file, it is to be used as a template
 * All possible imports are currently included at time this sample was created, however 
 * as this project develops, new directories may be created and this list will need to be updated.
 * 
 * To use junit in Gradle, run "gradle build" and "gradle test"
 * Gradle Junit test reports should populate in Kaesekuchen/build/reports/tests/test...
 * 
 * To use jacoco for code coverage report, run "gradle jacocoTestReport"
 * Gradle jacoco test report should populate in Kaesekuchen/build/reports/jacoco/test/html...

/*
 * The task was the creation of the sampleTest.java file, the test folder, 
 * and the addition of Junit and Jacoco to build.gradle. 
 * I don't know how to test the code coverage from this test specifically, 
 * but if you run a code coverage test on sampleTest.Java, 
 * you will see that code is covered 100% and that 
 * the class functions as intended. 
 * You can also run a sample a test via a CLI 
 * and see the correct .html outputs from Junit and jacoco.
