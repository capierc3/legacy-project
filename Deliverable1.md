### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Restore and refresh application to a modern, useable state.  

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 6

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 9

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> 7 of the user stories were mandated.  Additionally, the team voted on the top two user stories from that backlog that were deemed the most essential to add to the sprint.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> The team has discussed the areas they feel most comfortable working in and have agreed to split out the work based on skillset and comfort level.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, each member of the team has reviewed the project requirements in detail and understand what is expected of us.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TyotZRzZX0&feature=youtu.be

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We stabilized the Memoranda platform and made it more usable. We adapted it our Kasekuchen Gym Scheduler and we 
> analyzed the system to see future adaptation possibilities for the project, as well.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Yes, we fixed some large defects with the platform, and completed all of the user stories in Sprint 1 White Belt's 
> project board. We also translated the comments from other languages to help make it usable for the user as well as 
> for the development team. Getting it to a stable point was crucial for our work going forward. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, we determined some of the code that we can reuse for the program, and have made the program visually look more
> more like a Gym Scheduler program. 

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, our team met our sprint goal and finished all of the stories we agreed to complete. We do realize that there will
> be more pieces of the code that are not relevant and still need to be cleaned up. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> Yes, we completed the stories that we pulled into Sprint 1 from the backlog as well as the required stories. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> N/A

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Our team started off strong at the beginning of the sprint and finished strongly as well. As situations occurred,
> individuals had different availabilities and velocities, but our team kept a consistent pace. Our team continued to 
> communicate throughout the sprint with each other to keep our solid pace. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> The business value added is a bit difficult to quantify, but we set ourselves up for better development in the future.
> We found this sprint as a necessary non-value added, where the user may not see as much business value, but the work
> done in this sprint laid the ground work for our Sprint 2 development work. 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Our Quality Policy needs some improvement, such as commenting out code before removing it from the repo. Having a 
> better higher-level understanding of format and functionality that we want this application to have for the user. 
> Spending more time developing User Stories and Tasks to make sure we have a clear picture of what we want to achieve
> with this project. We also will be more cognizant of divvying out the work to make sure that no one is stepping on
> each other, code-wise.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Considering the world is on fire, we're feeling pretty good as a team and are really happy with each other and our
> progress so far.

 **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:

    - We met collectively to go over the workflow and quality policy at the beginning of the sprint. My main contribution was accidentally naming things after the task number (most of us did this, to be fair), which led to an ad-hoc policy update mid-sprint.

    - We met as a group to cover the workflow at the beginning of the sprint.
