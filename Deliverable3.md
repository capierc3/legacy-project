# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** Sprint 3

**Scrum Master**: Stephen Wilson

**Git Master**: Daimi Mussey

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:**  Focus on quality and stabilizing our current product.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  6 New User Stories

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 8 User Stories

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We believe that by adding these stories, we feel confident that we can complete these stories during this sprint. These added 
> functionality that we wanted to make sure was implemented, as well as included cleanup of code to make our product more
> stable.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We believe we can successfully complete these as we are more familiar with the code, and have a better understanding of
> the project deliverables. 
>
**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we had a sprint planning meeting to discuss what all needs to be accomplished and are in agreement.

 

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

 **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:

    - As a team, we discussed and decided upon no merging in of code that didn't pass Travis CI checks and making sure
    as a developer, you resolve those issues before moving the ticket to Ready For Test status.
